# GeoNetwork-UI applications deployment guide

This guide will offer you indications and advices for successfully deploying one or several GeoNetwork-UI applications in your infrastructure.

::: tip

Before diving into this guide, please refer yourself to the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) page to make sure your environment is ready for deploying GeoNetwork-UI applications, and to the [run guide](./run.md) to have a basic understanding on how GeoNetwork-UI applications are run.

:::

## Web Server

Geonetwork-UI applications are using **path-based routing strategy**. This means than an application deployed on `https://my.host.org/apps/<app-name>` can handle routes such as:

- `/apps/<app-name>/records/all`
- `/apps/<app-name>/settings`
- `/apps/<app-name>/search?q=road`

All these routes should in reality end up pointing to `/apps/<app-name>/index.html`, the rest of the path being interpreted by Angular.

This requires the relevant HTTP server to have a specific configuration for this to work (otherwise 404 errors will happen very often).

The configuration must essentially let the HTTP server know that if a required resource is not available, the request must be redirected to the application `index.html` file.

### NGINX

For Nginx, edit your server configuration to redirect to the application `index.html` as fallback.

```text
server{
    listen 80;
    listen [::] 80;
    server_name www.example.com example.com;
    root /var/www/example;
    index index.html;
    location / {
        try_files $uri$args $uri$args/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

### Apache

For Apache, you first need to activate the rewrite module :

```bash
a2enmod rewrite
systemctl restart apache2
```

Then there are two options available. You can either add the following lines in an `.htaccess` file alongside the application `index.html` file, or in a directory rule inside your `httpd.conf`:

```bash
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]
RewriteRule ^ {link_to_angular}/index.html
```

Replace `{link_to_angular}/index.html` with your needs.

## Authentication

GeoNetwork-UI applications rely on the GeoNetwork authentication mechanism. This means that if the user is authenticated in GeoNetwork, they will have access to authenticated features in the corresponding GeoNetwork-UI apps.

There are a few caveats, depending on the deployment scenario:

::: details :relieved: GeoNetwork and GeoNetwork-UI are deployed on the same host

> e.g. https://my.host/geonetwork and https://my.host/datahub

In this scenario, requests from the GeoNetwork-UI app to GeoNetwork are _not_ [cross-origin requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#what_requests_use_cors), so CORS rules do not apply.

GeoNetwork has an XSRF protection by default, which _will_ make authenticated requests fail unless the following is done:

- either make sure that the XSRF cookies sent by GeoNetwork have a `path` value of `/`; this is typically done like so in GeoNetwork:

  ```diff
  --- a/web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/config-security/config-security-core.xml
  +++ b/web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/config-security/config-security-core.xml

       <property name="cookieHttpOnly" value="false"/>
  +    <property name="cookiePath" value="/"/>
     </bean>
  ```

  Also make sure that the GeoNetwork API URL used by the application is _not_ an absolute URL; a relative URL should be enough in that scenario:

  ```diff
  --- a/conf/default.toml
  +++ b/conf/default.toml
  @@ -5,7 +5,7 @@
  [global]
  -geonetwork4_api_url = "https://my.host/geonetwork/srv/api"
  +geonetwork4_api_url = "/geonetwork/srv/api"
  ```

- or disable the XSRF protection selectively for non-critical endpoints of GeoNetwork, e.g. https://my.host/geonetwork/srv/api/userSelections for marking records as favorites; this is typically done like so in GeoNetwork:

  ```diff
  --- a/web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/config-security/config-security-core.xml

::: details :sweat: GeoNetwork and GeoNetwork-UI are <u>not</u> deployed on the same host

> e.g. https://my.host/geonetwork and https://another.org/datahub

In this scenario, even if CORS settings are correctly set up on GeoNetwork side, most authenticated request will probably fail because by default they are not sent with the [`withCredentials: true`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials) option.

As such, **authenticated requests are not yet supported in GeoNetwork-UI in the case of a cross-origin deployment**; non-authenticated requests (e.g. public search) should still work provided CORS settings were correctly set up on the GeoNetwork side (see [CORS response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#the_http_response_headers)).

Lastly, even if authenticated requests were cleared regarding CORS rules, it would still be needed to disable the XSRF mechanism for the endpoints that GeoNetwork-UI relies on; XSRF protections works by making the client read the content of an HTTP cookie, and that is forbidden in a cross-origin context

## Improved search fields

ElasticSearch offers the possibility to preprocess the records of a catalog, and this can be leveraged to **improve the search experience in GeoNetwork-UI**. This is done by registering so-called [ingest pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ingest.html).

GeoNetwork-UI provides several pipelines, for instance:

- [Metadata Quality](../guide/metadata-quality.md) score
- Show better, human-readable data formats

The two options for registering the pipelines are explained below.

::: tip
Once pipelines are registered, the GeoNetwork catalog should be fully reindexed again.
:::

::: warning
**Please note that destroying and recreating the GeoNetwork index _will_ disable the pipelines!** These should simply be registered again afterward.
:::

### Option A: Executing a Node script

This will require having `node` installed on the device, as well as a direct HTTP access to the ElasticSearch instance (i.e. not just access to the GeoNetwork API).

First clone the GeoNetwork-UI repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:geonetwork/geonetwork-ui.git
cd geonetwork-ui
```

Then run the following script with the appropriate options:

```shell
node tools/pipelines/register-es-pipelines.js register --host=http://localhost:9090
```

The `--host` option is used to point to the ElasticSearch instance.
If ElasticSearch is secured, `--username` and `--password` can be used to pass HTTP Authentication.
Additionally, the `--records-index` option can be used if the index containing the metadata records is not called `gn-records`.

### Option B: Running a docker image

A docker image called `geonetwork/geonetwork-ui-tools-pipelines` can be used to register pipelines automatically on startup.

To run it:

```shell
docker run --rm --env ES_HOST=http://localhost:9200 --network host geonetwork/geonetwork-ui-tools-pipelines
```

Here the `ES_HOST` environment variable is used to point to the ElasticSearch instance. Note that this host will be used _from inside the docker container_, so to access an instance on `localhost` the `--network host` option is also required.

The `RECORDS_INDEX` environment variable can be used to a different index name if it is not called `gn-records`.

## Enabling user feedbacks

The [Datahub](../apps/datahub) application lets users post feedbacks (comments) on the records of the catalog. This feature has to be enabled in GeoNetwork first:

1. Log in to GeoNetwork with an administrator account
2. Go to administration > settings > system settings  
   e.g. http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/fre/admin.console#/settings/system
3. In "User feedback" section, check "Enable feedback"
4. **only for GeoNetwork version 4.2.5 and below**:
   the user feedbacks API will fail if a SMTP host is not properly configured; this is done in the "Feedback" section, option "SMTP Host"; _this does not need to be a valid host, as long as it's not empty_
5. Click on the "Save settings" button in the top right corner of that page
