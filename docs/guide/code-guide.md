# Code guide

## Standalone components

Since Angular 15 [standalone components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components) are now officially supported. They offer many advantages and should be used as much as possible, both for new developments and when refactoring existing code.

Standalone components have the following differences with legacy "non-standalone" ones:

- Standalone components are _not_ declared in Angular Modules; instead, they act as their own module, declaring their own dependencies and providers
- Standalone components can import either Angular modules or other standalone components

Existing components are migrated progressively to become standalone as continuous improvement.
All new components must be created as standalone.

## Testing

### Fixture Guidelines

When creating fixtures for testing, we should ensure that each test operates with an independent instance of the fixture data to prevent unintended side effects between tests.

Instead of using a shared fixture object, encapsulate the fixture data within a function that generates a new instance for each test.

#### Structure of a Fixture File

Each fixture file should follow a consistent structure to allow for both flexibility and reusability. The recommended structure includes:

1. **A Generic Fixture Creation Function with Overrides**: This function, named using the convention `createModelNameFixture`, is responsible for generating fixture objects. It should accept an optional `overrides` parameter that allows specific properties of the fixture object to be customized for individual tests.

2. **Preconfigured Specific Fixtures**: Below the generic fixture function, include specific fixtures that represent common scenarios (e.g., a banned user, an admin user). These should follow the naming convention `specificScenarioFixture` (e.g., `bannedUserFixture`, `adminUserFixture`). These functions use the generic fixture creation function with predefined overrides to create specific fixture instances.

#### Example: User Fixture File (`user.fixtures.ts`)

```typescript
// Generic function to create a user fixture with optional overrides
export const createUserFixture = (overrides: Partial<User> = {}): User => ({
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  isBanned: false, // Default property
  role: 'user', // Default role
  ...overrides, // Apply overrides
})

// Specific fixture for a banned user
export const bannedUserFixture = (): User =>
  createUserFixture({
    isBanned: true,
  })

// Specific fixture for an admin user
export const adminUserFixture = (): User =>
  createUserFixture({
    role: 'admin',
  })

// Specific fixture for a guest user
export const guestUserFixture = (): User =>
  createUserFixture({
    role: 'guest',
  })

// Specific fixture for multiple users
export const someUsersFixture = (): User[] => [
  bannedUserFixture(),
  guestUserFixture(),
  // ...
]
```

This approach ensures test isolation, reduces the risk of shared state issues, and makes the test suite more maintainable and reliable.
Always place these fixture-generating functions in a dedicated directory (e.g., fixtures) for easy reuse across the project.

### Unit tests

#### ng-mocks

Unit tests are meant to be shallow. We should only test the behaviour of a component or a service by controlling the inputs and dependencies, and checking the outputs and results.

Angular provides many tools to clearly split the responsabilities between each components and services. The testing library `ng-mocks` relies on those tools, to provide an easy way to mock dependencies.

See commit `01dfc84d5e127bd426238dd00395faa1697f0eaa` for a few examples.

Unit tests are migrated progressively to use `ng-mocks`.

#### Mocking services (legacy)

One of the advantages of the Angular [dependency injection](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-overview) system is the ability to use mock classes when testing a component or services.

This can be done by specifying providers in `TestBed.configureTestingModule`:

```ts
import { MyService } from './my-service'
import { MyComponent } from './my-component.component'
// ...

class MyServiceMock {
  someData$ = new BehaviorSubject([])
}

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  let component: MyComponent
  let myService: MyService
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyComponent>

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      providers: [
        {
          provide: MyService,
          useClass: MyServiceMock,
        },
        // ....
      ],
    })

    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent)
    myService = TestBed.inject(MyService)
    component = fixture.componentInstance
    fixture.detectChanges()
  }).compileComponents()

// ...
```

::: tip
When defining providers, **`useClass` should be preferred to `useValue`** to avoid side effects between test cases.  
Indeed, `useClass` means a new instance of a dependency is created for each test, whereas `useValue` reuses the same instance across all tests.

#### Targeting nodes in the DOM

When testing components, it is often useful to target nodes in the resulting DOM to check their presence/absence, text content etc.

To do this, it is recommended to add a `data-test` attribute to the target node in the component's HTML template, for instance:

```html
<div>My component</div>
<div *ngIf="data$ | async as currentData" data-test="show-data">
  {{ currentData }}
</div>
```

This makes the HTML template easier to read and avoid confusion with e.g. CSS classes.

#### Mocking translations

When testing components that use translations, the [`ngx-translate-testing`](https://github.com/mwootendev/ngx-translate-plugins) package provides a special module that should be used:

```ts
import { TranslateTestingModule } from 'ngx-translate-testing'
// ...

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  let component: MyComponent
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyComponent>

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [
        TranslateTestingModule.withTranslations({
          en: {
            'my.translation.key':
              '{count} objects were found.',
          },
        })
          .withDefaultLanguage('en')
          .withCompiler(new TranslateMessageFormatCompiler()),
      ]
    }).compileComponents()

    // ...
```

For standalone components, the following method should be used instead:

```ts
import { TranslateTestingModule } from 'ngx-translate-testing'
// ...

describe('MyStandaloneComponent', () => {
  let component: MyStandaloneComponent
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyStandaloneComponent>

  beforeEach(() => {
    const testingModule = TranslateTestingModule.withTranslations({
      en: {
        'my.translation.key':
          '{count} objects were found.',
      },
    })
      .withDefaultLanguage('en')
      .withCompiler(new TranslateMessageFormatCompiler())

    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      // ...
    }).overrideComponent(MyStandaloneComponent, {
      add: {
        providers: [...testingModule.providers],
      },
    })

    // ...
```

### End-to-end tests

#### Targeting nodes in the DOM

Similarly to unit tests, a `data-cy` attribute can be used to target elements in the DOM:

```html
<div>My component</div>
<div *ngIf="data$ | async as currentData" data-cy="show-data">
  {{ currentData }}
</div>
```

## Storybook

All UI components should theoretically appear in Storybook (launched through `npm run storybook`).

An introduction to creating stories for Angular components can be found [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/whats-a-story).

A typical story should:

- let the user manipulate all inputs in all ways possible in order to see how the component reacts
- let the user see all outputs emitted by the component
- let the user resize the container in which the component sits in order to see how the component handles its size; this can be done like so:
  ```ts
  export default {
    // ...
    decorators: [
      // ...
      componentWrapperDecorator(
        (story) => `
          <div class="border border-gray-300" style="width: 450px; height: 100px; resize: both; overflow: auto">
             ${story}
          </div>`
      ),
    ],
  } as Meta<MyComponent>
  ```

### Stories for standard components

Quite often, components will rely on other modules. These should be imported like so:

```ts
export default {
  title: 'Category/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
  decorators: [
    moduleMetadata({
      imports: [
        // import whatever module is required
        // ...
        // note: these are required if the module needs translations:
        UtilI18nModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot(TRANSLATE_DEFAULT_CONFIG),
      ],
    }),
    applicationConfig({
      providers: [
        // provider wheter is needed here
      ],
    }),
  ],
} as Meta<MyComponent>
```

### Stories for standalone components

Stories for standalone components are usually set up a bit differently:

```ts
export default {
  title: 'Category/MyStandaloneComponent',
  component: MyStandaloneComponent,
  decorators: [
    // module imports may not be required since the component should already import everything it needs
    applicationConfig({
      providers: [
        // provide here what's needed; for translation this is:
        importProvidersFrom(UtilI18nModule),
        importProvidersFrom(TranslateModule.forRoot(TRANSLATE_DEFAULT_CONFIG)),
      ],
    }),
  ],
} as Meta<MyStandaloneComponent>
```

## Event handling

### Stopping click event propagation

In order to stop click event propagation you should use `propagateToDocumentOnly` from `@geonetwork-ui/util/shared` instead of `event.stopPropagation` to ensure that the document receives the event.

```ts
import { propagateToDocumentOnly } from '@geonetwork-ui/util/shared'

// ...

handleClick(event: Event) {
  // do stuff
  event.preventDefault()
  propagateToDocumentOnly(event)
}
```

This guarantees that the document will still receive the event so that components such as dropdowns can react to a click outside and close.
