# Introduction

## Why GeoNetwork-UI ?

The GeoNetwork-UI project has been conceived as a way to depart from the long-standing and hard-to-use GeoNetwork interface,
and offer new functionalities and better user experience on top of the existing GeoNetwork API. Its core functionalities are
a **powerful search engine**, various **data visualization** components, and a better support for **non-geographic and open data** resources.

Read the [Vision](./vision.html) section to understand better which approach is being adopted for this project and why.

GeoNetwork-UI offers different applications suited to different use-cases. Applications are documented
in the [corresponding section](../apps/datahub.html).

## Community
