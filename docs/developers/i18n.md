# Internationalization

Every label visible to the user in the different applications must be translated. All labels are identified using keys, for example:

- `table.object.count`
- `results.layout.selectOne`
- `datafeeder.summarizePage.illustration`
- `catalog.title.welcome.html`

A repository of _all translations_ is available in the [translations](https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-ui/tree/main/translations) folder. **These are the
translations used in the different applications of the GeoNetwork-UI project.**

::: info
Please note that **only the translations whose key end in `.html`** can accept HTML markup.

## Language of the User Interface

The User Interface supports translated labels and switching languages at runtime. The [`ngx-translate` library](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core) is used to handle all i18n aspects in GeoNetwork-UI.

The `TranslateService` class, provided by `TranslateModule`, offers several functionalities:

- reading the current language using `currentLang` (this gives the value at a certain time and is not an observable)
- changing the current language using the `use()` method

Languages in GeoNetwork-UI should always be identified by their [two-character codes following the ISO-639-1 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

## Supported languages

Currently, a small amount of languages is supported, see: https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-ui/blob/main/libs/util/i18n/src/lib/i18n.constants.ts

## Where translations are stored

All translated labels are stored in JSON files situated in the [`translations`](https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-ui/tree/main/translations) folder at the root of the project.

The rules for showing the translated labels on screen are:

- if available, use the label for the current language
- if that is not available, use the label for english as fallback
- if that is unavailable as well, simply show the raw translation key on screen

## How to include translated labels in GeoNetwork-UI

- use the `| translate` pipe or `translate` directive
- avoid using instant translation in the code: in case the language is switched dynamically, labels translated that way will not be updated
- if translation keys are computed dynamically, use the [`marker()`](https://github.com/biesbjerg/ngx-translate-extract-marker) function to declare them beforehand; **translation keys should be discoverable statically by analyzing the source code!**
- be sure to use separate closing tags as the extraction script may not find them otherwise (eg. `<div></div>` instead of `<div/>`). Even "non-closed" child elements can become an issue here.

When a contribution adds new translated labels, the `npm run i18n:extract` command (which relies on the [`ngx-translate-extract`](https://github.com/biesbjerg/ngx-translate-extract) library) should be run and its results committed separately. English labels should always be provided for new keys as this is the fallback language.

## How to contribute new translations

Simply open a PR modifying the translated labels as you see fit. **Adding or removing keys in the translation files should only be done through the `npm run i18n:extract` command.**

## How the User Interface language is detected

The user will be able to change the language via a language switcher dropdown in the Interface.

The language:

- is stored in local storage under `geonetwork-ui-language`
- will use the browser language by default, if no language found
- can be changed in the local storage externally and will be taken into account after a refresh
