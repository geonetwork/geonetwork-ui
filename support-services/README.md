# Support services

This folder contains a docker composition which can simulate an actual GeoNetwork 4 instance to be used
for testing and development on GeoNetwork-UI.

The instance is already prepared with a few sample records and offers a reproducible development and testing environment.

## Requirements

[Docker Compose version 2+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Start

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
```

On the first run, the database will be populated with the settings and sample records.

A quicker startup can be obtained by only targeting the `init` service:

```shell
$ docker compose up init -d
```

To clear the volumes and let the database repopulate itself from scratch, run:

```shell
$ docker compose down -v
```

## Specifying a different GeoNetwork version

By default, the version of GeoNetwork used as a backend is 4.2.5. You can specify another version like so:

```shell
$ GEONETWORK_VERSION=4.2.2 docker compose up -d
```

## Access services

GeoNetwork can be accessed on http://localhost:8080/geonetwork.

Kibana can be used to inspect the ElasticSearch index and experiment with requests; it is accessible on http://localhost:5601.

## Regenerate the initial database state

Running the following command will extract the current state of the database and store it as the new initial state:

```shell
$ docker compose exec database pg_dump -U geonetwork -d geonetwork -Fp > docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/dump.sql
```

Warning: Only run this command when running Geonetwork in version 4.2.2, as otherwise the DB will be migrated and e2e tests may fail.

Please also keep in mind that the initial state of the database should be as lightweight as possible and that changing it might break
integration tests relying on it.
